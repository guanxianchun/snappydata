# SnappyData Monitoring Console

SnappyData Monitoring Console is a dashboard that provides a real-time view into cluster members, member logs, resource usage, running Jobs, SQL queries along with performance data.  This simple widget based view allows you to navigate easily, visualize, and monitor your cluster. You can monitor the overall status of the cluster as well as the status of each member in the cluster.
All the usage details are automatically refreshed after every five seconds.

!!! Note
	SnappyData Monitoring Console is not yet tested and supported on Internet Explorer.

To access SnappyData Monitoring Console, start your cluster and open [http:`<leadhost>`:5050/dashboard/](http:`<leadhost>`:5050/dashboard/) in the web browser.

!!!Note
	`<leadhost>` is the hostname or IP of the lead node in your cluster which is provided in the **conf/leads** file.

![Dashboard](../Images/MonitoringUI/SnappyData-UI-Dashboard.png)

The following topics are covered in this section:

* [Dashboard](#dashboard)

* [Member Details](#memberdetails)

* [Jobs](#jobs)

* [Stages](#stages)

* [Spark Cache](#spark_cache)

* [Environment](#environment)

* [Executors](#executors)

* [SQL](#sql)


!!! Note
	When connecting to a SnappyData cluster using Smart Connector, the information related to **SQL**, **Jobs**, and **Stages** are NOT displayed, as the Jobs and queries are primarily executed in your client Spark cluster. You can find this information on the Spark UI console of your client cluster. Read more about SnappyData Smart Connector Mode [here](../affinity_modes/connector_mode.md).

In cases where you cannot access the SnappyData Monitoring Console to analyse Jobs and tasks, you must turn on the [Spark History server](#historyserver).


On the top-right side of the SnappyData Monitoring Console page, you can view the version details of SnappyData Snapshot. When you click this, the name and version of the product, the build details, the source revision details and the version number of the underlying spark are displayed.

On the top of the dashboard, the date and time details about when the cluster is started are displayed. The period till when the cluster is running is also shown.

<a id="sql"></a>
## SQL
The SQL section shows all the queries and their corresponding details along with their execution plans and stagewise breakups.


![](../Images/MonitoringUI/query_analysis_sql.png)

| Item  | Description |
|--------|--------|
|  **Colocated**         |     When colocated tables are joined on the partitioning columns, the join happens locally on the node where data is present, without the need of shuffling the data. This improves the performance of the query significantly instead of broadcasting the data across all the data partitions.   |
|**Whole-Stage Code Generation** |  A whole stage code generation node compiles a sub-tree of plans that support code generation together into a single Java function, which helps improve execution performance.      |
|    **Per node execution timing**    |   Displays the time required for the execution of each node. If there are too many rows that are not getting filtered or exchanged.     |
|   **Pool Name**     | Default/Low Latency. Applications can explicitly configure the use of this pool using a SQL command `set snappydata.scheduler.pool=lowlatency`.       |
|**Query Node Details**|   Hover over a component to view its details.     |
|     **Filter**   |   Displays the number of rows that are filtered for each node.      |
|    **Joins**    |   If HashJoin puts pressure on memory, you can change the HashJoin size to use SortMergeJoin to avoid on-heap memory pressure.      |

<a id="spark_cache"></a>
## Spark Cache

Spark Cache is the inbuilt storage mechanism of Spark. When you do a `dataSet.cache()`, it uses this storage to store the dataset's data in a columnar format. This storage can be configured to be one of the following:

- MEMORY_ONLY,
- MEMORY_AND_DISK,
- MEMORY_ONLY_SER,
- MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER,
- DISK_ONLY,
- MEMORY_ONLY_2,
- MEMORY_AND_DISK_2

For more details, see [RDD Persistence section](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html).

<a id="environment"></a>
## Environment
The Environment page provides detailed configurations for Spark environment including JVM, SparkContext, and SparkSession.

<a id="executors"></a>
## Executors
Executors are the entities that perform the tasks within a Spark job. Each Spark job is divided into multiple stages which can have one or more tasks depending on the number of partitions to be processed. All these tasks are scheduled on executor nodes which actually run them.

<a id="jobs"></a>
## Jobs
The **Jobs** page lists all the Spark jobs. Each Spark action is translated as a Spark job. A job encapsulates the whole execution of an API or SQL. For example, `dataSet.count()` triggers a job.

[comment]: <> (Need a brief introduction here.)

![](../Images/MonitoringUI/query_analysis_job.png)

* **Status**: Displays the status of the job.

* **Stages**: Click on the stage to view its details. The table displays the time taken for the completion of each stage. 

!!! Tip
	You can cancel a long running job, using the **Kill** option. </br>![kill](../Images/kill_job.png)

<a id="stages"></a>
## Stages
The **Stages** page displays the stage details of a Spark Job. Each Spark job is segregated into one or more stages. Each stage is an execution boundary where data exchange between nodes is required.

On this page, you can view the total time required for all the tasks in a job to complete. You can also view if any of the tasks got delayed for completion. This may occur in case of uneven data distribution.

![](../Images/MonitoringUI/query_analysis_stage.png)

* **Scheduler Delay** indicates the waiting period for the task. Delays can be caused if there are too many concurrent jobs.

* **Shuffle reads and writes**: Shuffles are written to disk and can take a lot of time to write and read. This can be avoided by using colocated and replicated tables. You can use high-performance SSD drives for temporary storage (spark.local.dir) to improve shuffle time.

* **Number of parallel tasks**: Due to concurrency, multiple queries may take cores and a specific query can take longer. To fix this, you can create a new scheduler and [assign appropriate cores to it](../best_practices/setup_cluster.md).

* **GC time**: Occasionally, on-heap object creation can slow down a query because of garbage collection. In these cases, it is recommended that you increase the on-heap memory, especially when you have row tables.

<a id="historyserver"></a>
## Spark History Server
The Spark History server is a Spark UI extension. It is a web application that lets you analyze the running as well as completed SQL queries and the associated Spark jobs. The metadata collected in the form of event logs by the Spark History server can be shipped from a SnappyData cluster to another SnappyData cluster for further analysis.

The first step in tuning query performance in SnappyData is to understand the query physical plan that is available through the SQL tab on the SnappyData Monitoring console. The detailed execution plan requires one to understand the jobs and tasks associated with the query. This is available in the Jobs/Tasks tab. However, if the SnappyData Monitoring console is not accessible to the investigator, it becomes a difficult exercise. To overcome this, TIBCO recommends to turn on the History server for production applications.

To turn on the History server, do the following:

1.	Ensure to provide a shared disk that can be accessed from all the SnappyData nodes. If you do not have the NFS access, use HDFS. Provide the necessary permissions to access a shared folder when you start SnappyData.
2.	Enable event logging for the Spark jobs. For example, specify the following properties in **conf/lead**:

            -spark.eventLog.enabled=true -spark.eventLog.dir=hdfs://namenode/shared/spark-logs

3.	Additionally, set the following property in **conf/spark-defaults.conf** file (it defaults to **/tmp/spark-event**s):

			spark.history.fs.logDirectory      hdfs://namenode/shared/spark-logs

    If this property is not set and the directory **/tmp/spark-events** does not exist, Spark History server fails to start.

5. By default, the history server loads only 1000 most recent events (SQL, Jobs, Stages). Older events will not be visible. To retain more number of events, set additional properties using **SPARK_HISTORY_OPTS**, and also increase the heap-size of the history server as follows in the file **conf/SPARK_ENV.sh**.

             SPARK_HISTORY_OPTS="-Dspark.history.fs.numReplayThreads=16 -Dspark.ui.retainedJobs=10000 -Dspark.ui.retainedStages=20000 -Dspark.sql.ui.retainedExecutions=10000"
             SPARK_DAEMON_MEMORY=12g
     	
    !!!Note 
    	When you retain a high number of events, it increases the disk space requirement. Therefore, ensure that the disk store, where the events are stored, has adequate disk space.

4.	Start the History server.

			./sbin/start-history-server.sh

	This creates a web interface at *http://<server-url>:18080* by default, listing incomplete and completed instances of SQL queries and the associated Spark jobs and tasks.
    For more details about History server, refer to [Configuring History Server](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#environment-variables).
